# Magic Maths Question Generator
Generates random maths questions that can act as "sums" for the [Magic Maths](https://www.orchardtoys.com/buy/magic-maths-game_373.htm "Magic Maths game homepage") game by Orchard. This can extend the game's life beyond the physical card-based questions that come with it.

Currently very much an experiment and work-in-progress (and also acts as a testing ground for Vue.js)

**Note:** This project is in no way associated with [Orchard Toys](https://www.orchardtoys.com/) or the game of the same name and is not official in any way.

## Details

You can configure a list of answers (that can correspond to the answers on the physical cards in the actual Magic Maths game) and this will generate random maths questions for each of those answers. The questions types are weighted, so you can configure it so that it's more likely to generate an addition question than a division question, for instance.

## Try it Out

A very alpha version (that generates random questions based on a fixed list of answers) can be seen at:
